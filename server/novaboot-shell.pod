=head1 NAME

novaboot-shell - provides novaboot with unified SSH-based interface for controlling target hardware

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<novaboot-shell> -c "[command [arguments...]]"

B<novaboot-shell> [command [arguments...]]

B<ssh target@server> [command [arguments...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<novaboot-shell> provides L<novaboot(1)> with a unified SSH-based
interface for controlling the target hardware. This simplifies
client-side configuration, because clients typically need only the
I<--ssh=...> option. B<novaboot-shell> is typically configured as a
login shell of special user accounts associated with the target
hardware (as set by L<adduser-novaboot(8)>). It ensures that users can
perform only a limited set of actions (see L</COMMANDS> below) with
the target and have no shell access on the server.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 8

=item console

Connect to target console (usually serial line). When somebody is
connected to the console, other users are blocked from controlling the
target. Blocked users see a message indicating who blocks them.

The user connected to the console is able to invoke other commands
such as L</reset>, but only when the command is invoked via the same
SSH connection. This can be accomplished by using SSH connection
sharing, which is what L<novaboot(1)> uses (see I<-M> and I<-S> in
L<ssh(1)>).

This is the default command when no command is specified on the
command line and C<default_cmd> is not set in the configuration file.

=item reset

Reset the target hardware.

=item on

Power on the target hardware.

=item off

Power off the target hardware.

=item rsync [...]

This command is not meant to be invoked directly by the user. It
allows using L<rsync(1)> to copy files to the target, perhaps for TFTP
server. The rsync command must be invoked as: C<rsync ...
target@server:>, i.e. without specifying destination path. The files
will be stored into I<$HOME/tftproot>.

=item user <uernamename> [admin]

User command is meant to be used with C<command=> option in SSH's
L<authorized_keys(5)> file. It allows the shell to display
human-readable names when printing information about who blocks the
target. Then, the real command is taken from SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
environment variable.

When "admin" is specified after the user name, this user is considered
an administrator and is allowed to run L</add-key> and L</shell>
commands.

=item get-config

Prints novaboot configuration options needed for the target. One
option per line.

=back

=head2 Administration commands

Only administrators (see L</user>) are allowed to execute these
commands.

=over 8

=item add-key <username>

Reads the SSH public key from standard input and adds it into in
F<~/.ssh/authorized_keys>.

Example: C<ssh target@server add-key johndoe < john_rsa.pub>

=item shell

Runs shell on the server. Useful for editing configuration file. It is
better used with allocated pseudo-terminal.

Example: C<ssh -t target@server shell>

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

B<novaboot-shell> reads configuration file from
F<$HOME/.novaboot-shell>. It can define values for the following
variables in the shell syntax.

=over 8

=item console_cmd

Command to C<exec> that connects to target's console.

Note that if you need more complex behaviour of the console command,
e.g., different behaviour for different users (distinguished by the
value of C<$NB_USER> variable), you can set this variable to a name of
a shell function, which you define in the configuration file and
implement the complex behaviour there.

=item reset_cmd

Command to C<exec> that resets the Target.

=item on_cmd

Command to C<exec> that powers the target on.

=item off_cmd

Command to C<exec> that powers the target off.

=item target_config

Novaboot command line options that specify which boot loader is used
by the target (L<novaboot(1)> rejects other, possibly dangerous, options).
Each option is on its own line and no quoting, escaping or stripping
is performed on the values.

Example:

  target_config="\
  --uboot=(uboot)
  --uboot-init=setenv serverip 192.168.1.1; setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.10
  --uboot-addr=kernel=0x8100000
  --uboot-addr=fdt=0x83000000
  --uboot-addr=ramdisk=0x83100000
  "

=item default_cmd

If set, this command is executed when no command is specified on the
command line. If not set, C<console_cmd> is executed instead.

As F<novaboot> (client) always uses the C<console> command to connect
to the console, C<default_cmd> can be used to boot the target with
some default configuration for users who do not use F<novaboot> client
to boot their own configuration.

In other words, C<ssh board@host> will boot the board in some default
configuration, whereas C<novaboot --ssh=board@host ...> will boot the
board as configured in C<...>.

Often, it is desired to run F<novaboot> on the server to boot the
default configuration. To make this easier to configure, the
C<default_cmd> can be set to:

  run_novaboot <nbscript> [<extra args>...]

This command will execute C<novaboot> with the F<\<nbscript>> script
as an argument and passes it a few switches with values from the
F<$HOME/.novaboot-shell> configuration file. Specifically, it will
pass all switches from the C<target_config> variable, C<--reset-cmd>
and C<--remote-cmd> switches with the values of C<reset_cmd> and
C<console_cmd> variables respectively (see above) and C<--server>
switch.

Therefore, to boot the default configuration as specified in the
F<default_boot> script, it is sufficient to set C<default_cmd> to:

  run_novaboot ./default_boot --interactive

To have different default configuration for different users, one can
use the C<$NB_USER> variable as outlined above. The simplest example
is perhaps this command:

  run_novaboot ./default_boot-"$NB_USER" --interactive
